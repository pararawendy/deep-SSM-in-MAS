# deep-SSM-in-MAS
Code implementation of deep state-space models (SSM) in multi-agent-systems (MAS) as proposed by Indarjo's master thesis (2019)

Outline:
1. Explain about the method, incl. how to use the method
2. Method with covariance structure
3. method implementation (explain the toy problem), note: modif toy problem in phase 2 (ground truth of 2nd agent)

## Problem assumptions
